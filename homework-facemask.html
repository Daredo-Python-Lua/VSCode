    <h2 class="a">What is a face mask</h2>
    <p class="a">Face masks are one tool utilized for preventing the spread of disease.  They may also be called dental, isolation, laser, medical, procedure, or surgical masks. Face masks are loose-fitting masks that cover the nose and mouth, and have ear loops or ties or bands at the back of the head. There are many different brands and they come in different colors. It is important to use a face mask approved by the FDA.</p>
    <h2 class="a">What is a face mask used for</h2>
    <p class="a">Facemasks help limit the spread of germs.  When someone talks, coughs, or sneezes they may release tiny drops into the air that can infect others. If someone is ill a face masks can reduce the number of germs that the wearer releases and can protect other people from becoming sick.  A face mask also protects the wearerâ€™s nose and mouth from splashes or sprays of body fluids.</p>
    <h2 class="a">When should a face mask be worn</h2>
    <p class="a">Consider wearing a face mask when you are sick with a cough or sneezing illness (with or without fever) and you expect to be around other people.  The face mask will help protect them from catching your illness.  Healthcare settings have specific rules for when people should wear face masks.</p>
    <h2 class="a">How to put on and remove a face mask</h2>
    <p class="a">Disposable face masks should be used once and then thrown in the trash. You should also remove and replace masks when they become moist.

        Always follow product instructions on use and storage of the mask, and procedures for how to put on and remove a mask.  If instructions for putting on and removing the mask are not available, then follow the steps below.</p>
